# Bee_Microbiome

## INTRODUCTION
The repository "Bee_Microbiome" to ensure availability of the data and code files used for the report: "A Meta-Analysis on the 16s-rRNA Gut Microbiome Data of Honey Bees 	(Apis Mellifera)". The paper was submitted to complete the BIOC0023 Level 6 module of the BSc Biochemistry course at UCL and it is currently being worked on for publication. **Therefore the repository is subject to continuous changes **. 

The data and the files uploaded here allow and instruct the user to investigate the microbiome from 4 16s-rRNA amplicon sequencing studies carried out on samples of bee microbiomes. These 4 studies were the only ones out of a body of 26 (as of the ends of October 2020) which made their data available, labelled appropriately, and provided barcodes for demultiplexing where necessary.
